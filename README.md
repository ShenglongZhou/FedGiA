# FedGiA
This Matlab package solves federated learning problems via gradient descent and inexact ADMM

To implement this solver, please run **demonXXXX.m** to see how it works

This source code contains the algorithm described in the following paper:

*Shenglong Zhou and Geoffrey Ye Li, FedGiA: An efficient hybrid algorithm for federated learning, IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing, 71, 1493-1508, 2023.* 		 

Please credit this paper if you use the code for your research.
